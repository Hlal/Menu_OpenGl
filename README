Problem	: Implementing a drop down menu in OpenGl
Site	: http://agarwalchirag.wordpress.com

OBJECTIVE :

	Creating a drop down menu from scratch in OpenGl. Here, I've made the menu just for 'FILE' and 'EDIT'.
	The 'FILE' menu has 4 sub-menus which further have sub-menus as follows:
		- 'New'
			> 'File'
			> 'Project'
		- 'Open'
		- 'Save'
		- 'Exit'
		
	The 'EDIT' menu has 4 sub-menus as follows:	
		- 'Undo'
		- 'Redo'
		
	The colour of the menus changes when mouse pointer is hovered above them. The menus open up and close as in any other GUI.
	When you click on a submenu, say 'File > New > Project', this path is displayed on the terminal. Of course, any other functionality can also be added to it. The program opens up a similar new window on clicking 'Open' and exits on clicking 'Exit'.

FILES :

1) menu_final.c :
	The only file that contains the entire code.

HOW TO RUN MY PROGRAM ?

	Windows : Simply open the code in MS Visual Studio or any other IDE. Make sure you have the OpenGl libraries present. Compile it and run. Google should help you out otherwise.
	
	Linux : Make sure you have installed freeglut. When compiling, use 'gcc -o exe menu_final.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut' followed by './exe'
